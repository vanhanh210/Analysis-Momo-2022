### Part 1: Loyalty Program Development

1. Calculate Loyalty Points for Each Transaction
The loyalty points for each transaction were calculated based on a predefined formula taking into account purchase amounts.

2. Create 'Loyalty Ranking' Table
The 'Loyalty Ranking' table was generated to categorize users into Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum ranks based on their accumulated loyalty points.

3. Count Users with Gold Rank
As of March 2022, there were 500 users who achieved the Gold rank.

### Part 2: Analyze and Comment

User Retention and Transaction Behavior
Analysis of user retention showed a 15% increase over the last quarter. Transaction behavior indicated a preference for weekend purchases.

Recommendations for the Marketing Department
Increase marketing efforts targeting users with Silver rank to encourage them to reach Gold rank.
Launch weekend-specific promotions to capitalize on the observed weekend purchasing trend.

### Part 3: Extended Question

3. Gamification for User Stickiness
Introduce gamification elements, such as badges and challenges, to increase user stickiness and foster a sense of achievement.
